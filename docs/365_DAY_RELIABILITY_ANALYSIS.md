```

**📧 Email Difference**: Emails to GM only on weekdays, but data operations continue daily.

## 🧠 **SMART FILE CHECKING SYSTEM**

### 📊 **File Count Intelligence**
✅ **Morning Slot (9:00 AM)**: Expects 4+ files  
✅ **Afternoon Slot (12:30 PM)**: Expects 4+ additional files (8+ total)  
✅ **Auto-Retry Logic**: If expected files not found, automatically retries  
✅ **State Tracking**: Remembers previous counts to validate increases  
✅ **Intelligent Decisions**: Only downloads when needed  

### 🔄 **Retry Mechanism**
```python
if current_files < expected_files:
    retry_download()  # Automatic retry
else:
    skip_download()   # Files already present
```

## 🎯 **VBS SOFTWARE CLOSURE GUARANTEE**

### 🔒 **Phase 3 VBS-Only Closure**
✅ **Targeted Termination**: Only kills VBS processes (absons*.exe, moonflower*.exe)  
✅ **Graceful Close**: Alt+F4 → ENTER → Process termination  
✅ **Verification**: Ensures VBS is fully closed before exit  
✅ **No Interference**: Other applications remain untouched  
✅ **Clean Exit**: Proper cleanup and logging  

### 🛡️ **Process Management**
```python
# ONLY terminates VBS processes
vbs_processes = [
    "absons*.exe",      # VBS application
    "moonflower*.exe",  # Alternative VBS name
    "wifi*.exe",        # WiFi VBS variant
    "vbs*.exe"          # Generic VBS process
]
# Does NOT touch: Chrome, Excel, Outlook, etc.
```

## 🎛️ **TIMELINE FLEXIBILITY**

### ⚙️ **Easy Time Changes**
✅ **GUI Configuration**: Click → Change time → Save → Done  
✅ **Instant Updates**: Re-run setup to update Windows scheduler  
✅ **No Code Changes**: Python files remain untouched  
✅ **Multiple Slots**: Add unlimited additional time slots  
✅ **Format Validation**: Prevents invalid time entries
