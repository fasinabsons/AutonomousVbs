## 🛠️ **CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **❌ ISSUE:** Browser not minimized in BAT execution  
**✅ FIXED:** Added `BAT_EXECUTION` environment variable detection
```python
is_bat_execution = os.environ.get('BAT_EXECUTION') == '1'
if is_bat_execution:
    chrome_args.extend([
        "--start-minimized",
        "--window-position=-2000,-2000",  # Off-screen
        "--window-size=800,600"
    ])
```

### **❌ ISSUE:** White screen causing navigation failures  
**✅ FIXED:** Comprehensive white screen detection with auto-refresh
```python
def check_for_white_screen(self) -> bool:
    white_screen_indicators = [
        page_state != "complete",
        len(body_text) < 50,  # Very minimal content
        "404" in page_title or "404" in body_text,
        "error" in page_title.lower()
    ]
    return any(white_screen_indicators)
```

### **❌ ISSUE:** Email system too complex  
**✅ FIXED:** Simplified to use only `email_delivery.py` for personal notifications
- CSV BAT uses ONLY `email_delivery.py`
- Email Morning BAT uses ONLY `outlook_automation.py`
- Clean separation of responsibilities

### **❌ ISSUE:** No weekday restriction for GM emails  
**✅ FIXED:** Added weekday checking in both BAT and Python
```batch
for /f %%i in ('powershell -Command "(Get-Date).DayOfWeek.value__"') do set DAY_OF_WEEK=%%i
if %DAY_OF_WEEK% EQU 0 (
    echo ⏰ Today is Sunday - GM emails only sent on weekdays
    exit /b 0
)
```
