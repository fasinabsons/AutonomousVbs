VBS Phase 1: Login Process Documentation
============================================

PURPOSE:
Automate the login process for the VBS application using keyboard navigation and credentials.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
- PyAutoGUI for keyboard automation
- Win32API for window management and focus control
- Logging for step-by-step execution tracking
- TAB navigation for reliable field traversal

PROCESS FLOW:
1. Window Detection
   - Find VBS application window by title keywords
   - Validate window is visible and active
   - Set focus to VBS window

2. Two-Cycle Login Approach
   FIRST CYCLE (Clearing):
   - Tab 3 times to reach Company field
   - Clear Company field (Ctrl+A, Delete)
   - Tab to Financial Year field
   - Clear Financial Year field
   - Tab to Username field
   - Clear Username field
   - Tab to Password field
   - Clear Password field
   
   SECOND CYCLE (Filling):
   - Tab 3 times to reach Company field
   - Type "EHC"
   - Tab to Financial Year field
   - Type "2025-26"
   - Tab to Username field
   - Type "admin"
   - Tab to Password field
   - Type "admin"

3. Login Execution
   - Press Enter to submit login
   - Wait for login completion (1-2 seconds)
   - Verify successful login

CRITICAL FEATURES:
- Dual-cycle approach prevents field contamination
- TAB navigation is more reliable than clicking
- Window focus management prevents interference
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

TIMING REQUIREMENTS:
- 0.3 seconds between TAB presses
- 0.3 seconds after field clearing
- 1 second wait after login submission
- Total execution time: ~10-15 seconds

ERROR HANDLING:
- Window not found: Retry window detection
- Focus lost: Refocus VBS window
- Field navigation failed: Log error and continue
- Login timeout: Report failure and exit

INTEGRATION:
- Called by: automation_workflow.bat
- Next phase: vbs_phase2_navigation_fixed.py
- Runtime: ~1 minute as specified in requirements
